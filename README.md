# Wrestlers

Creates a graph of wrestlers and their rivalries (imported from an external file), then analyzes the graph to determine which wrestlers are 'babyfaces' and which are 'heels', as well as whether or not all rivalries are between a babyface and a heel. The program determines if all rivalries are legitimate (between a babyface and a heel), and outputs which wrestlers are babyfaces and which are heels if so, and 'Impossibe' if not.

Input file is organized as follows:

First line: number of wrestlers to follow

Next lines: names of wrestlers

Next line: number of rivalries to follow

Next lines: pairs of wrestler names

To change the name of the input file, alter the file name in line #79.
